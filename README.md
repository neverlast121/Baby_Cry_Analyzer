# Baby_Cry_Analyzer

In the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, one of the more tender-hearted applications is the development of baby cry analyzers. These sophisticated systems utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery, to interpret the different cries of infants.

The architecture of these models, such as the audio_tagging_cnn, is designed to recognize and classify various sound patterns. By training on a custom dataset of baby cries, the model learns to discern the subtle differences between cries caused by hunger, discomfort, belly pain, and more. This technology not only showcases the versatility of CNNs but also holds the potential to become an invaluable tool for new parents and caregivers.

The process involves recording the cry, performing a Fast Fourier transform on the spectrogram of the audio, and then feeding this data into the trained machine learning model. The outcome is a prediction of the baby's problem.
